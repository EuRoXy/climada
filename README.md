=======

climada core module (MATLAB)

this contains the full climada distribution. To get it all in one, click on the "Download ZIP" button on the lower right hand side of github, or just clone this repository. Works both if main folder renamed to 'climada' or left as 'climada-root', just source startup.m in MATLAB and test using climada_demo.
