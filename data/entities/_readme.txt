entity_template.xl is THE reference entity template to start from (it shall always contain all possible features an entity file does provide)

the file demo_today.xls is used for the demo (also serves as a template)
the file demo_today.mat can be generated from demo_today.xls with climada_entity_read, but is provided for those users with difficulties to read Excel to get started.

the file USFL_MiamiDadeBrowardPalmBeach_today_exercise.xls is the file used for the climada exercise, see manual and exercise sheet.

Please save Excel files as Excel 5.0/95 workbook or as Excel 97-2004 workbook (.xls), since MATLAB seems to have troubles reading them otherwise (e.g. as .xlsx)
