the file demo_today.xls is used for the demo (also serves as a template)
the file USFL_MiamiDadeBrowardPalmBeach_today_exercise.xls is the file used for the climada exercise, see manual and exercise sheet

Please save Excel files as Excel 5.0/95 workbook or as Excel 97-2004 workbook (.xls), since MATLAB seems to have troubles reading them otherwise (e.g. as .xlsx)
