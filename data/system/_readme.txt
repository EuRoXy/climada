this folder contains system files, such as the centroids, the shape file for the global map (admin0.mat), some colormaps and the images (demo_*.png) for the demo.

admin0.* are the files to draw admin0 (country) borders etc. see admin0.txt

demo_illu?.png are the three images used in climada_demo on the upper left panel

USFL_MiamiDadeBrowardPalmBeach_centroids.xls are centroids to be used as a template (but the user might rather look into climada module country risk, climada_high_res_entity or the module GDP_entity and there climada_create_GDP_entity

colormap*.mat are various color maps, used for hazard intensity plots etc.

In past versions, this folder also contained world_50m.gen, a generalised shape file. This file is now with climada module GDP_entity, as core climada moved to admin0.mat (see e.g. climada_plot_world_borders).
